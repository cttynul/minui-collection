# MinUI Collection

This Python script is designed to **automatically generate custom collection files** (`.txt`) for the **MinUI** frontend, commonly used on some handhelds.

It searches the `Roms` folder on your SD card for files that match specific search parameters and excludes others based on your input, creating a clean list of ROMs for your custom collection.

## üöÄ Run

1.  **Save the Code:** Save the provided Python code into a file named, for example, `minui.py`.
2.  **Open Terminal/Command Prompt:** Navigate to the directory where you saved the file.
3.  **Execute:** Run the script using the Python interpreter:

    ```bash
    python minui.py
    ```

## üõ†Ô∏è Usage

The script will guide you through a few simple steps, asking for the necessary information to create your collection.

### 1. Enter the SD card path

The script will first ask for the path to your **SD card**.

* **Example (Windows):** `E:\`
* **Example (macOS/Linux):** `/Volumes/MIYOOSD` (Note: The script might need adjustments for non-Windows paths, but for typical use, entering the mount point should work.)

### 2. Enter the collection name

This will be the name of the generated file (`<name\>.txt`) and how it appears in the **Collections** menu.

* **Example:** `Pokemon`
* **Resulting file:** `E:\Collections\Pokemon.txt`

### 3. Enter search parameters

Enter one or more keywords that **must** be present in the ROM filename (case-insensitive) for the file to be included in the collection. Separate multiple parameters with **commas** (`,`).

* **Example:** If you enter `mario,bros`, only files containing **both** "mario" **and** "bros" will be included (e.g., `Super Mario Bros.nes`).

### 4. Enter exclude parameters
Enter one or more keywords that, if present in the ROM filename (case-insensitive), will **exclude** the file from the collection. Separate multiple parameters with **commas** (`,`).

* This is useful for filtering out unwanted files like **ROM hacks**, **translations**, **demos**, or specific regional versions.
* **Leave empty** and press Enter if you don't want to exclude anything.

### Output
Once completed, the script will confirm the location of the newly created collection file inside the `Collections` folder on your SD card.

## üí° MinUI Collections

Collection files (`.txt`) are not **official** supported but last MinUI versions can handle a **`Collections`** folder in the root of MinUI SD card. Each line in the file must contain the **absolute path** of a ROM, relative to the SD card root (starting with `/`).

Example of a collection file content:

```
/Roms/GBA/Final Fantasy VXI.gba
/Roms/GBA/Final Fantasy Advance (USA).gba
/Roms/SNES/Final Fantasy IIXXI (USA).sfc
/Roms/NES/Final Fantasy Really (Hack) (USA).nes
```
